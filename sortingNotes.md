## Classification of Algorithims
- number of swaps required
- number of comparisons required
- the use of recursion in the algorithm
- stability of the sorting algorithims
- space requirements of the algorithm
### Bucket sort
divides inpud into buckets then using separate algos like insertion sort
### Counting
