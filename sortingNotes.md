## Classification of Algorithims
- number of swaps required
- number of comparisons required
- the use of recursion in the algorithm
- stability of the sorting algorithims
- space requirements of the algorithm
### Bucket sort
divides inpud into buckets then using separate algos like insertion sort
### Counting sort
Involves taking a count of each occurence of the integer in a separate array then unwrapping the array using its indices
### Insertion Sort
- compares key index to the first index
- if the key index is smaller the values are swapped
- key index is increased by one
